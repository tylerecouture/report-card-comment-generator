# TERM MARKS































































































































XE has struggled to complete XIS course projects.































































































































In a course where students are expected to submit their work every day for assessemnet, XE only submits his work about once per week.































































































































In a course where students are expected to submit their work every day for assessment, XE has only submitted work XIS work a few times int he past month.































































































































If XE wants to pass this course, XE will need to start handing in XIS work on a more regular basis.































































































































Students are expected to submit work (or work in-progress) every day in this course.  XE will need to start handing in this work more regularily if XE wants to improve XIS mark.































































































































So far, XE has given the minimum effort required to maintain a passing mark.































































































































































































XIS limited attendance so far this semester is preventing XIM from succeeding in this course. XE can still pass, but XE will need to start attending class and submitting work regularily.

 # GREAT MARKS





























































































































































































































































 XIS mark was well earned.































































































































 # LOW MARKS































































































































 Unfortunately, XE did not complete many assignments during the second term, causing XIS mark to drop significantly.































































































































 XIS poor attendance/punctuality had a significantly negative impact on XIS mark.































































































































 XE completed the bare minimum required to pass the course.































































































































 Unfortunately, XIS lack of punctuality/attendance prevented XIM from attaining a better mark.































































































































 XE did not take advantage of the opportunity to come in during Flex or Assessment Week to complete missing assignments.































































































































 XE made a great effort during assessment week to ensure XE passed the course.  I would suggest XE might be better off completing more work during the semester than waiting until the last minute!































































































































 XE put in a great effort during assessment week to ensure a pass in the course.































































































































 # FAIL

 Although XE did put in significant effort during assessment week, it was too little too late.































































































































 The language barrier may have been too high too succeed in this course full of technical language.

 I do, however, hope that XE returns to the Hackerspace for a future course to give it another try.
