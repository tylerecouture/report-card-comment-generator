XE is an amazing artist, but I would like to see XIM expand XIS digital art skills to try new tools and styles.

XIS poor attendance/punctuality influenced XIS mark.
XE completed the bare minimum required to pass the course.
Unfortunately, XIS lack of punctuality/attendance prevented XIM from attaining more than the minimum mark required to pass the course.
XE did not take advantage of the opportunity to come in during Flex or Assessment Week to complete missing assignments.

If he returns in the future for another course in the Hackerspace I would encourage him to take advantage of the many other digital tools that are available to learn about.
